# Convolutional Neural Networks

### Applications

- Signal and image processing.
- Handwritten text/digits recognition.
- Natural object classification(photos and videos).

- Segmentation.
- Face Detection.
- Recommender System.
- Speech Recognition.
- Natural language processing.

### Original Goal of CNN

"How to create `good representations of the visual world` in a way it could be used `to support recognition`?"

#### Key Features:

- Detect and classify objects into categories.
- Independence from pose, scale, illumination, conformation and clutter.

### Inheritance from the real world

Input Image -> Primitve Features -> Object Parts -> Object
