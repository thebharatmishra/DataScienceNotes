# Deep Learning

Tool used extensively in Deep Learning is Tensorflow.

### TensorFlow:

- Heavy numerical computations
- Based on Data Flow Graphs
- TensorFlow can run on small devices too(android, ios, ).

### What is a Data Flow Graph?

- Nodes: Matematical Operations
- Edges: Mutli-Dimensional Arrays (Tensors).
- Standard usage: BUILD >> EXEC

### What is the meaning of tensors?

Different variables can be represented as different dimensions.

A Image might have variables & properties such as height, width, hue, saturation, etc.

### Computation Graph Ingredients

Basically, y=mx+b,

where, m= Weight Matrix, x= Feature Matrix, b= Bias Terms

### NOTE: From Tensorflow 2.0, keras has become a sub-part of it. Also Eager Execution has become the default.

### Use Case of Deep Learning:

- Healthcare Biology
  - Cancer Detection
  - Drug Discovery
- Media Entertainment
  - Video Captioning
  - Real-time translation
- Autonomus Car transformation
  - Lane tracking
  - Vehicle Detection
- Securtiy Public Safety
  - Face recognition
  - Video Surveillance
- Consumer Web Mobile Retail
  - Video Captioning
  - Real time translation

### Why is popular now?

- Increased computational capabilities.
- Access to so much available data.
- Advances in development of ML Algorithms.

### Deep Learning:

Supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised methods.

### Deep Neural Networks:

![](../../files/deep-nn.png)

- Neural Networks with more than 2 layers.
- Sophisticated mathematical modelling
- To extract feature sets automatically
  - images, videos, sound and text

### Types of Deep Neural Networks:

- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
- Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM)
- Deep Belief Networks (DBN)
- Autoencoders
